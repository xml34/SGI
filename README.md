# SGI Api

Hi! This is SGI, an API that supports crud for Products, on the near future 
we hope to support more services !

# Documentation
For know the documentation is within the same project so... you'll need to run
it to see it 😞  
The upside of this is that this project is too easy to run with docker! 🐳  
so... run it and go to the swagger http://localhost:8000/docs#

# How To Run Locally

Fist, make sure you have Docker installed on you Pc, Then
1) `docker-compose build`  
2) `Docker-compose up`  
3) `docker compose exec app alembic upgrade head`  
And yes, that's it. 😉👍🏻
